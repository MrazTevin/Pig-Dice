    <div id="panel">
      <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945.[1] As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice,[2] and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.
         Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided into two categories: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games. In jeopardy race games, the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score (e.g. Pig, Pass the Pigs, Cosmic Wimpout, Can't Stop). In jeopardy approach games, the object is to most closely approach a goal score without exceeding it

    <div id="zip">Game Play</div>
    <div id="play">
      <p>Each player in turn throws the die and continues to throw the die until either a 1 is thrown or they decide to stop.  If a 1 is thrown they score nothing for that turn.  If they elect to stop before a 1 is thrown they score the total of the numbers thrown in that turn.  The scores are noted for each turn and the player who obtains a total score over 100, wins the game, provided they are not then out-scored by a subsequent player who has thrown one fewer rolls and still has a turn left.

      <div id="tip">Scoring Examples</div>
      <div id="day">
        <p>Example 1: Sandra rolls a 3 and decides to continue. She then chooses to roll seven more times (6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, 1). Because she rolled a 1, Sandra's turn ends and she earns 0 points.
           Example 2: Opiro rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses to roll four more times (3, 4, 2, 6) and decides to hold. Opiro earns 21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6=21).
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="lip">Variations</div>
      <div id="lay">
        <p>You can play Pig with two dice.  A 1 thrown with either die means a player scores nothing and ends their turn.  A double-1 ends a player's turn but scores 25 points regardless of what they may have accumulated with the previous throws of that turn.  Any other double, doubles the score for that throw.  For example - double 6, totalling 12, scores 24 points.
